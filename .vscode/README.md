Enable debugging of AWS CDK Typescript
---
## Overview
VSCode comes with a built-in debugger which comes in handy whenever you get an unexpected behaviour in your code and youâ€™d like to dig in.
Since CDK allows us to use a general purpose programming language (e.g. TypeScript), this VSCode feature can be useful for infrastructure code as well.

NOTE: You will need to change ignite-aws-backup-s3.ts if this is not the name of the .ts file that is within the bin/ directory.
